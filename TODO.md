# TODO List

Various todos to take care of at some point.

- Queries that use the blockExplorerApiUrl need to have that definedin the queryKey so the query can refetch on data changes.
  - can't test this until we have network switching working
- Queries of block explorer need to be only for L2.
- show history of transfers related to token on assets page?
- Need to add network switching
- Queries need to use active network selected, not from wallet
